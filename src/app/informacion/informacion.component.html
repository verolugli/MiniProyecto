        The Pokédex is a digital encyclopedia created by Professor
        Oak as an invaluable tool to Trainers in the Pokémon
         world. It gives information about all Pokémon in the
          world that are contained in its database, although
          it differs in how it acquires and presents information
          over the different media. However, they are also only given
           to a few Trainers at a time, generally to the ones that are felt to have
            exceptional potential and skill. There are different types of Pokédexes and
            each Pokédex is special to a specific region. Pokédex entries typically describe a
            Pokémon in only two or three sentences. They may give background information on the
            habitat or activities of a Pokémon in the wild or other information on
             the Pokémon's history or anatomy. Pokédex
              entries also include height, weight, cry,
               footprint (prior to Generation VI), location,
                other forms, and a picture of the Pokémon.


                The Pokédex is a handheld electronic encyclopedia device; one which is capable of recording and retaining information of the various Pokémon of the world. In order to accomplish Professor Oak's goal of a complete Pokémon database, the Pokédex is designed to find and record data on each Pokémon the Trainer meets. Pokémon are added to the Pokédex simply by encountering them in battle or, sometimes, by seeing a picture of the Pokémon. However, detailed entries are not recorded until the player catches the Pokémon, receives it as a prize/gift or acquires it in a trade.
        The main feature of any Pokédex are the entries on each individual Pokémon, which provide details that would otherwise be unexplored in the games. Complete entries can only be seen for captured Pokémon, while uncaptured Pokémon only have limited information.
